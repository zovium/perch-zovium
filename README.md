- **State/Data**: React Hooks, Fetch API
- **Auth**: NextAuth.js (Google OAuth + Credentials)

### Backend (`apps/api`)
- **Framework**: [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) (Python 3.11+)
- **Database**: MongoDB (via AsyncIOMotorClient)
- **ODM**: [Beanie](https://beanie-odm.dev/) (Pydantic-based ODM)
- **Cache & Pub/Sub**: Redis (for WebSocket broadcasting and rate limiting)
- **Real-Time**: WebSockets (Starlette)

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Python 3.11+
- Node.js 20+
- Git

### 1. Clone the Repository & Setup Infrastructure

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zovium/perch-zovium.git
cd perch-zovium

# Start MongoDB and Redis using Docker Compose
docker compose up -d mongo redis
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` in the root directory.
2. Update the `.env` file with your specific configurations (e.g., `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`, `JWT_SECRET`, database URIs).

### 3. Start the Backend API

```bash
cd apps/api
python -m venv .venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows:
.venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Seed the database (Creates the default Super Admin)
python -m app.seed 

# Start the FastAPI server
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```
> **Note**: The seed script creates a default super admin. Check the console output for the generated credentials.

### 4. Start the Frontend Application

Open a new terminal window:

```bash
cd apps/web
npm install
npm run dev
```

### 5. Access the Platform

- **Customer App**: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- **Admin Panel**: [http://localhost:3000/admin/login](http://localhost:3000/admin/login)
- **Interactive API Docs (Swagger)**: [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs)

## 📱 Testing QR Codes & WebSockets with a Real Device

To test scanning QR codes and using the app from your mobile device, you need to expose your local server using a tunnel like `ngrok`:

```bash
# Start an ngrok tunnel on the frontend port
ngrok http 3000
```

1. Copy the generated HTTPS URL (e.g., `https://random-string.ngrok-free.dev`).
2. Update the `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` and `NEXTAUTH_URL` in your `.env` file to this ngrok URL.
3. Restart your Next.js and FastAPI servers.
4. Generate a QR code from the Admin Panel, scan it with your phone, and test the real-time chat and ordering!

## 🛡️ Default Dev Credentials
If you run the `seed.py` script, the default development admin is usually set up as:
- **Email**: `superadmin@perch.store`
- **Password**: `admin123`
*(Check your terminal output during the seed process for exact credentials)*

> ⚠️ **SECURITY WARNING**: These credentials and the default JWT/NextAuth secrets are for local development ONLY. You must rotate and secure these before deploying to production.
